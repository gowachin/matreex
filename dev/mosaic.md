## Introduction

This document is set to test the different migration or mosaic setups
and develop code to simulate this. This is purely experimental and rely
on the dev branch of the `{matreex}` package.

``` r
devtools::load_all()
```

    ## â„¹ Loading matreex

``` r
library(dplyr)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
    ## 
    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag
    ## 
    ## The following object is masked from 'package:testthat':
    ## 
    ##     matches
    ## 
    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
library(ggplot2)
options(W_matreex_edist = FALSE)
options(cli.progress_show_after = 600) 
```

## Regional pool

The idea is to add recruitment from a regional pool with a constant
proportion of species and add the recruit produced with a migration
rate.

The recruitment function for a species $s$ is edited such that :

$$
R_s = \alpha BA_s^\beta \cdot e^{-\delta BA_s} \cdot e^{-\epsilon BA_h}\\
R_s = [(1-m)\alpha BA_s^\beta +  m \alpha BA_r^\beta] \cdot e^{-\delta BA_s} \cdot e^{-\epsilon BA_h}
$$

$BA_s$ is the local basal area of the species, $BA_r$ is the regional
basal area of the species and $BA_h$ is the local basal area of other
species. $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ are parameters
fitted for each species. $m \in R: 0 \leq m \leq 1$

To simplify, the recruitment is impacted by regional fecundity, but the
competition is still local.

### Implementation

This is just the creation of the species required for latter
simulations, not much fun yet.

``` r
data("fit_Abies_alba")
data("climate_species")
climate <- subset(climate_species, N == 2 & sp == "Abies_alba", select = -sp)
climate
```

    ##         PC2 N       SDM

``` r
Abies_ipm <- make_IPM(
    species = "Abies_alba",
    climate = climate,
    fit = fit_Abies_alba,
    clim_lab = "optimum clim",
    mesh = c(m = 700, L = 90, U = get_maxdbh(fit_Abies_alba) * 1.1),
    BA = 0:120,
    verbose = TRUE
)
```

Now forest class require to have regional abundance, that is basal area
and migration rate. These values are required to follow the order of the
species.

```

Another key edit is that we need to create an alternative recruitment
function where the fecundity rely on the regional basal area. The
default recruitment function is $rec\_fun(BA_s, BA_h)$ and the new one
is $rec\_fun_{regional}(BA_s, BA_r, BA_h)$ :

$$
R_s = (1-m) \cdot rec\_fun(BA_s, BA_h) + m \cdot rec\_fun_{regional}(BA_s, BA_r, BA_h)
$$

$$
R_s = (1-m)\alpha BA_s^\beta \cdot e^{-\delta BA_s} \cdot e^{-\epsilon BA_h} + m \alpha BA_r^\beta \cdot e^{-\delta BA_s} \cdot e^{-\epsilon BA_h}
$$

This edit is possible with the `regional` option of the internal
function `exp_recFun()`.

``` r
list_covs <- climate
params <- fit_Abies_alba$rec$params_m
matreex:::exp_recFun(params, list_covs)
```

    ## function (BATOTSP, BATOTNonSP, mesh, SurfEch = 0.03)

\*This edit highlight that our simulation are heavily dependant on the
basal area for competition and not very open for other competition
indices.

### Simulations

Now are several examples to test if it works.

First, I start from equilibrium and compare with and without migration.
I expect no differences.

``` r
equil_dist <- dplyr::filter(Abies_sim, equil, var == "n") %>% dplyr::pull(value)
equil_BA <- dplyr::filter(Abies_sim, equil, var == "BAsp") %>% dplyr::pull(value)


Abies_spE <- Abies_sp
Abies_spE$init_pop <- def_init_k(equil_dist)
comp_time <- 500

regional_Abies <- forest(
    species = list(Abies = Abies_spE),
    regional_abundance = equil_BA,
    migration_rate = c(Abies = 0.05)
)

regional_sim <- sim_deter_forest(
    regional_Abies,
    tlim = comp_time,
    equil_time = comp_time, equil_dist = 10,
    SurfEch = 0.03,
    verbose = TRUE
)
```

    ## Simulation with regional pool

    ## Starting while loop. Maximum t = 500

    ## time 500 | BA diff : 0.00

    ## Simulation ended after time 500

    ## BA stabilized at 48.59 with diff of 0.00 at time 500

    ## Time difference of 3.11 secs

``` r
isol_sim <- sim_deter_forest(
    forest(
        species = list(Abies = Abies_spE),
        regional_abundance = list(Abies = equil_dist),
        migration_rate = c(Abies = 0)
    ),
    tlim = comp_time,
    equil_time = comp_time, equil_dist = 10,
    SurfEch = 0.03,
    verbose = TRUE
)
```

    ## Warning in validate_forest(new_forest(species = species, harv_rules =
    ## harv_rules, : All migration rate are 0, the regional pool of this forest is
    ## deleted

    ## Starting while loop. Maximum t = 500

    ## time 500 | BA diff : 0.00

    ## Simulation ended after time 500

    ## BA stabilized at 48.59 with diff of 0.00 at time 500

    ## Time difference of 2.7 secs

``` r
regional_pool <- dplyr::bind_rows(regional = regional_sim, isolation = isol_sim,
                                  .id = "migration")

regional_pool %>%
    dplyr::filter(var %in% c("BAsp", "N"), !equil) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time, y = value, color = migration, linetype = migration)) +
    geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
    facet_wrap(~ var, scales =  "free_y") +
    NULL
```

![](mosaic_files/figure-gfm/onespsim-1.png)<!-- -->

Now we test two species. I expect no variations from equilibrium because
we start from equilibrium and the regional pool is at equilibrium.

``` r
e2_dist <- dplyr::filter(AbFa_sim, equil, var == "n") %>%
    dplyr::group_by(species) %>%
    dplyr::group_split() %>% map(pull, value)
e2_BA <- dplyr::filter(AbFa_sim, equil, var == "BAsp") %>% dplyr::pull(value)


Abies_spEn <- Abies_sp
Abies_spEn$init_pop <- def_init_k(e2_dist[[1]])
Fagus_spEn <- Fagus_sp
Fagus_spEn$init_pop <- def_init_k(e2_dist[[2]])


regional_AbFa <- forest(
    species = list(Abies = Abies_spEn, Fagus = Fagus_spEn),
    regional_abundance = e2_BA,
    migration_rate = c(Abies = 0.1, Fagus = 0.1)
)

sp2_sim <- sim_deter_forest(
    regional_AbFa,
    tlim = comp_time,
    equil_time = comp_time, equil_dist = 10,
    SurfEch = 0.03,
    verbose = TRUE
)
```

    ## Simulation with regional pool

    ## Starting while loop. Maximum t = 500

    ## time 500 | BA diff : 0.00

    ## Simulation ended after time 500

    ## BA stabilized at 56.64 with diff of 0.00 at time 500

    ## Time difference of 5.31 secs

``` r
sp2_sim %>%
    dplyr::filter(var %in% c("BAsp", "N"), !equil) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time, y = value, color = species)) +
    geom_line(linewidth = .4) +
    facet_wrap(~ var, scales =  "free_y") +
    NULL
```

One species is absent and colonise from regional pool. **Note : starting
a simulation with a species with 0 effectif is generally a bad idea, now
itâ€™s possible but do NOT abuse this possibility !**

I expect the new species to grow, but the lag will be visible. I donâ€™t
simulate until equilibrium, but I guess itâ€™s reached at some point.

``` r
Fagus_spE0 <- Fagus_sp
Fagus_spE0$init_pop <- def_init_k(e2_dist[[2]] * 0)
```

    ## Warning in def_init_k(e2_dist[[2]] * 0): sum(x) is equal to 0, the species will

    species = list(Abies = Abies_spE, Fagus = Fagus_spE0),
    regional_abundance = e2_BA,
    migration_rate = c(Abies = 0.1, Fagus = 0.1)
)

invas_sim <- sim_deter_forest(
    invasive_AbFa,
    tlim = comp_time,
    equil_time = comp_time, equil_dist = 10,
    SurfEch = 0.03,
    verbose = TRUE
)
```

    ## Simulation with regional pool

    ## time 500 | BA diff : 0.58

    facet_wrap(~ var, scales =  "free_y") +
    NULL
```

With the same start as those I used when looking from equilibrium, I
expect to reach equilibrium faster. This is because the recruitment is
drived by the regional pool. However, this speed might be dependant on
the migration rate.

``` r
rand_AbFa <- forest(species = list(Abies = Abies_sp,  Fagus = Fagus_sp),
                    regional_abundance = e2_BA,
                    migration_rate = c(Abies = 0.5, Fagus = 0.5)
)

set.seed(42)
